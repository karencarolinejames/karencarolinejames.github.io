1. Regular Visits to the Vet are Essential

Just like humans, pets can catch viruses, develop diseases, or even have something a simple as toothache. The best way to prevent distress for your pet and avoid costly vet bills is to catch as early as possible. 

Annual vet visits must cover, weight and nutrition as well as having a thorough examination.

2. Spay or Neuter Your Pets 

Last year the RSPCA reported that they had rescued or collected 128,209 animals from all over the UK. Some of these had been abandoned or grossly neglected. 
 
In order to avoid creating potentially unwanted lives, it's important to spay and neuter your pets. It's a safe procedure that can be performed as early as six to eight weeks. 

Not only does it cut down on unwanted pets, but it also statistically proven to lower certain types of cancers. 

3. Clean and Clip Fur

Over time your pets pick up all sorts of dirt and unwanted passengers in their fur.  It is important to give them regular washes when necessary and particularly in the case of longer furred creatures, regular clipping. 

These steps are three of many, one must take to ensure a happy and healthy pet.
